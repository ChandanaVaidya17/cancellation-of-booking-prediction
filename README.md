# Booking Cancellation Prediction
# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting booking cancellations using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of booking cancellations based on various features such as check-in dates, room types, and customer information. This can help businesses manage their bookings more effectively and reduce the impact of cancellations.

# Features
- Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Create relevant features for model training.
- Model Training: Train various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Performance Evaluation: Assess the performance of different models and select the best one.
# Dataset
The dataset should include relevant booking details such as:

- Check-in and check-out dates
- Room types
- Customer demographics
- Booking source
- Special requests
- Other relevant features
